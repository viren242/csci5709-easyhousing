# Group11_EasyHousing

Our group is creating a web application that will fulfill the need of students, working professionals, and other individuals
looking for a new house to rent. Finding an affordable place to live in a new area can be hectic, especially for students.
The situation worsens by the lack of digital infrastructure. Our motive is to make this task more manageable for individuals.
Our web application will allow property owners to market their properties. The customers can search for these
properties and book appointments. They can cancel the booked appointment as well. The customers who have booked appointments
can post reviews and ratings about the property. The application also allows the users to search the services like meals,
laundry, and other necessities. Also, the person with room for one or more people can advertise for roommates.
